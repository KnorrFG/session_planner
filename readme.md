# Session Planer

Thanks to everyone who looks at this.

session_planner.nim is the main-file, and contains the gui logic.
Im sorry, the user strings are all in german. "Punkte" means "points".
The first value of a point is its name, then there are x and y and optionally a
color.
Sessions describes the edges. When the gui is running, press ctrl+return to
render the graph
